# Project Ideas

## 1. Place food orders from home chefs in your locality

**Idea description** - A Mobile/web application that connects home chefs and users. Home chefs will be able to register their dishes and the availability at their convenience. The users will be able to place food orders from home chefs near their location. Users will be shown recommendations based on their past orders, chef ratings, dish ratings and other data collected through the app. We will also incorporate Google assistant/Alexa integration. Users will be able to use these voice assistants to place orders.

**Goal of the Project** - To empower home chefs by providing a platform to sell home cooked food. Also, help users find healthy and tasty home cooked food in their community.

**Tech Stack** - (Web - ReactJs & MobileApp - ReactNative ), Cloud Firestore- Realtime NoSQL cloud Db by Google, Google cloud Platform, Google Assistant/Alexa Integration, ML Integration.

## 2. Buy / Sell / Validate - Parking Permits

**Idea description** -  The user will be able to see all the available parking locations near him/her to book a spot. Parking lot owners can register their lot using Geo Fencing and validate parking by using Computer Vision. 

**Goal of the project** - The user will be able to see all the available parking locations near him/her to book a spot. Parking lot(commercial/individual owned) owners can register their lot and validate parking by using Computer Vision and Geo Fencing. They can specify the timings for which the spot is available and add/remove spots at their convenience. Users will be notified of when their permit is expiring.  

**Tech Stack** (Tentative) - React Native, Google Maps API , Cloud Firestore NoSQL Database, Cloud Vision API

## 3. Virtual trainer 

**Idea description** - A virtual workout trainer which detects if you are using the right form of exercise(eg. Yoga form) for the workout using Posenet, also gives points based on the correctness of the posture. The app will try to gamify your workout experience.

**Goal of the project** - This app can be used by anyone who wants a virtual trainer anywhere/anytime to track and gamify their workouts.
